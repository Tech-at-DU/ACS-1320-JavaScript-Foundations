# Overview

This class will be an OOP workshop to review the concepts from the previous class and expand your understanding of OOP to include inheritence.

<!-- > -->

## Why learn Classes and Inheritance?

This is a big topic which reaches deeply into important areas of computer science. Expect to see OOP and inheritance in the libraries you might work with, in interview questions, and on the job as a software engineer. 

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

1. Create base/superclasses 
1. Use inheritance with `super` and `extends`
1. Create classes that inherit from a superclass

<!-- > -->

# Inheritance 

Inheritance is when you get something from your ancestors. By definition it's the act of passing property from an ancestor to a descendant. Properties can be: 

- genes - üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üíáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- money - üí∞ üíé
- property - üè° üöó

<!-- > -->

In software a class can inherit properties and methods: 

- variables/properties - `'Foo', 999.999`
- methods/functions - `function draw() {}`

<!-- > -->

Who do _you_ inherit from? 

- Your parents - üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶
- Your grandparents - üëµüèΩ

<!-- > -->

In software who do you inherit from?

- Your parent/superclass -
  - `Rectangle` inherits from `Polygon`
  - `Pokemon` inherits from `GameObject` inherits from `Sprite`

<!-- > -->

## Inheritence with JS

Any class can inherit from another class. You can also think of classes that inherit from another class as **extensions** of the other class. So you could say one class extends another class.

<!-- > -->

```js
// Sprite defines two properties and one method
class Sprite {
  constructor() {
    this.x = 0
    this.y = 0
  }

  render() { ... }
}

// Ball has all of the properties and methods 
// that Sprite has and adds one new property
class Ball extends Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, radius = 10) {
    super(x, y) // Calling super initializes the super class!
    this.radius = radius
  }
}

// Making an instance 
const ball = new Ball(0, 0) 
// { x: 0, y: 0, radius: 10, render: function(){ ... } }
```

<!-- > -->

Calling `super()` in a subclass is like calling the constructor function in your **superclass**. You must supply any arguments that are required. 

**You must call `super()`!** It's how the properties in the super class get initialized!

<!-- > -->

If a class takes parameters in its constructor it **must pass these to super**. 

```js
class Sprite {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = 0
    this.y = 0
  }

  render() { ... }
}

class Ball extends Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, color, radius) {
    super(x, y) // Must pass parameters to super!
    this.color = color
    this.radius = radius
  }
}
const ball = new Ball(10, 20, 'red', 30) 
// { x: 10, y: 20, color:'red', radius: 30 }
```

<!-- > -->

You must pass parameters to super. Notice the constructor takes these parameters, **calling super is like calling the constructor of the superclass.**

<!-- > -->

# Inheritance Challenges

**Challenge 1**: many of the classes you created for Break Out share some of the same properties. Moving these to a super class would keep them in one locaiton that could be shared, edited, and make it easier to reason about. This would make your code DRY. 

<!-- > -->

All of these classes: 

- `Ball`
- `Paddle`
- `Brick`
- `Lives`
- `Score` 

<!-- > -->

Share these properties: 

- `x`
- `y`

<!-- > -->

Sprites represent an object on the screen. They can all use these methods:  

- `move(x, y)`
- `render(ctx)`

<!-- > -->

Your goal with this challenge is to define a base class, let's call it Sprite. 

Here is some starter code: 

```js
class Sprite {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = 0
    this.y = 0
  }
}

class Ball extends Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, color, radius) {
    super(x, y) // Must pass parameters to super!
    this.color = color
    this.radius = radius
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

You may have to modify this to include other properties your classes might support. 

In this code sample the **`Sprite`** class supports the **`x`** and **`y`** properties and the **`Ball`** class adds **`color`**, and **`radius`**.

The Ball class is repsonsible for passing **`x`** and **`y`** to the super class. 

<!-- > -->

```js
class Sprite {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = 0
    this.y = 0
  }

  render() { ... }
}

class Ball extends Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, color, radius) {
    super(x, y) // Must pass parameters to super!
    this.color = color
    this.radius = radius
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

All of these classes should extend the new `Sprite` class. 

- `Ball`
- `Paddle`
- `Brick`
- `Lives`
- `Score`

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 2**: Some of the classes draw themselves with the same code.

- `Paddle`
- `Brick`

<!-- > -->

Both of these classes draw as Rectangles willed with a color. You can give the `Sprite` class a `render(ctx)` method. 

Doing this will allow any class that extends `Sprite` to use `render()` this method. 

<!-- > -->

Classes that draw themselves differently:

- `Ball`
- `Lives`
- `Score`

Will define their own `render()` which will override the render method defined in Sprite.

<!-- > -->

To render itself as a rectangle a Sprite should have a width and a height. 

```JS
class Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, width, height) {
    this.x = 0
    this.y = 0
  }

  render(ctx) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.rect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
    ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
    ctx.fill();
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

A ball could render itself as a circle by **overriding** the `render()` method.

```JS
class Ball extends Sprite {
  constructor(x, y, radius = 10, color = 'red') {
    super(x, y, radius * 2, radius * 2)
    this.radius = radius
    ...
  }

  render(ctx) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.closePath();
  }
}
```

Here you could say that Ball extends Sprite and overrides the render method of it's super class. Ball is the class, Sprite is the super class.
