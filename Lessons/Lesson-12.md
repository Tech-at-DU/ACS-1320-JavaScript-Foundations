## Giving Feedback

The best way to improve your work is through feedback from your peers. We all want to be the best we can be. One way to move above and beyond where you are currently is to advice from outside. 

After you've made the first presentation of your work. The best way to find new areas where you can improve that work is ask the people around you what they think. 

To be useful feedback needs to useful and actionable. If you have ideas but they won't be useful you might not need to mention them at all.

An easy what to format your feedback is in the form of: 

- Good - Say what you liked in the work
- Better - Say what you think could be working better
- Best - Mention what you liked best about the work

## Review work

Review your work with your peers. Each of you will present your work. Give yourself up to 5 minutes to show your work. Take a few minutes to provide feedback.

In groups of 4 take 3 to 5 minutes to show your work. Take a couple more minutes to provide feedback. 

Choose one person from your group to show their work to the whole class.
