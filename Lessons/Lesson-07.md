# ACS 1320 - Lesson 7 - Single Page Applications

<!-- Put a link to the slides so that students can find them -->

<!-- ‚û°Ô∏è [**Slides**](/Syllabus-Template/Slides/Lesson1.html ':ignore') -->

<!-- > -->

# Overview

Today we will talk about Single Page Applications, what they are, and one of the frameworks/libraries used to make them: React.

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the class you should be able to:

1. Describe Single Page Applications
1. Create your Single Page Application
1. Use React and `Create React App` to create a single page application
1. Use JSX to define UI
1. Create components with JS

<!-- > -->

## Single Page Applications ‚òùÔ∏è

<!-- > -->

A single application is a Single webpage that acts like a full application in your browser.

‚òùÔ∏è üåè

<!-- > -->

Single Page Applications are web pages that act like multipage static sites but are built from a single HTML file. 

‚òùÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è üìÑ üìÑ üìÑ

<!-- > -->

**These pages don't load or reload new HTML files. Instead, they rewrite the content of the existing HTML page to show new content.**

# React ‚öõ

<!-- > -->

React is a popular library/framework for making Single Page Applications.

‚òùÔ∏è ‚öõÔ∏è üåè

<!-- > -->

Here is what you need to know about React üßê

<!-- > -->

React projects are written in JS

‚öõÔ∏è

<!-- > -->

React uses ES6 and must be compiled with webpack and babel

‚öôÔ∏è

<!-- > -->

React applications are built with components.

üß±

Components are the building blocks of React Applications

üè°

<!-- > -->

React uses JSX üõ†

- JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language used to generate HTML
- JSX has it's own syntax



<!-- > -->

## Getting started

<!-- > -->

Make your first React app.

Use the Terminal to navigate a directory where you will build your first React Project.

```
npx create-react-app my-first-app
```

<!-- > -->

This command creates a new react starter project using the Create React tool.

```
my-first-app
``` 

would be the name of your app.

<!-- > -->

Run your app by navigating to the folder with:

```
cd my-first-app
```

Then launch the project with:

```
npm start
```

This runs the start script in package.json. You could alternately use:

```
yarn start
```

What's the difference between yarn and npm?

### Tour the React Project

<!-- > -->

The React project is a folder with several files and folders.

- **node_modules** - Contains all of the packages downloaded from npm
- **package.json** - npm configuration and options
- **public** - distribution folder
- **README.md** - A default Read for Create React App you should replace this!
- **scr** - Your source code! You will do all of your work here
- **yarn.lock** - ignore this it's auto-generated by yarn

<!-- > -->

You'll do all of your work in src take a look at it.

<!-- > -->

- **src**
  - **App.css** - CSS for App component
  - **App.js** - App Component
  - **App.test.js** - Tests for App component (ignore it for now)
  - **index.css** - CSS for index component
  - **index.js** - Entry point for your app don't edit this it's boiler plate code
  - **logo.svg** - It's the picture used in the default app
  - **serviceWorker.js** - optional code for special purposes ignore this
  - **setupTests.js** - more optional code testing, ignore this

<!-- > -->

## Components and JSX

<!-- > -->

Edit the existing components.

Look at **App.js**. This is a function that returns some HTML. Make a few changes:

- add an h1 tag - `<h1>Hello World</h1>`
- add another - `<h2>Foo Bar</h2>`

<!-- > -->

What's going on here? **This is JSX.** It looks like HTML.

- JSX is an extension of the HTML language
- JSX looks like HTML (mostly) and follows most the same rules
- JSX is converted to vanilla JavaScript during bundling
- JSX has a few rules you need to learn

Take a quick look at the reference:

https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html

<!-- > -->

### Defining your own components üß±

<!-- > -->

When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:

1. Class-based components
2. Functional components

<!-- > -->

A Class-based component has a render method that returns JSX.

```JS
class Heading extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

A functional component is just a function that returns JSX.

```JS
const Heading = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}
```

<!-- > -->

Use either component in your app like this:

```JSX
<Heading />
```

<!-- > -->

Use a variable in a component:

```JS
const Heading = () => {
  const str = 'Foo Bar'

  return <h1>{str}</h1>
}
```

<!-- > -->

When writing JS expressions (JS code) inside a block of JSX you must wrap is in the curly braces

```JSX
<h1>{str}</h1>
```

<!-- > -->

### Props

<!-- > -->

Props are an important part of components. **Props are attributes passed into a component. The component then receives the attributes as a prop object**

<!-- > -->

In class-based components:

```JS
class Heading extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1>{this.props.str}</h1>
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

In functional components:

```JS
const Heading = props => {
  return <h1>{props.str}</h1>
}
```

<!-- > -->

Pass props to your component through attributes:

```JSX
<Heading str='Hello World' />
```

Any attribute passed into a component will be available to the component through the **props object**.

<!-- > -->

Now the component can be reused and configured to display any string.

```JS
<Heading str='Hello World' />
<Heading str='Foo Bar' />
<Heading str='Foo World' />
<Heading str='Hello Bar' />
<Heading str='Hello foo' />
<Heading str='Foo Hello' />
```

<!-- > -->

Usually, you'll want to put each component into it's own file. Do that with the `Heading` component.

<!-- > -->

- Make a new file named: Heading.js (best practice: use the Component name as the file name)
- Save the file to the src directory (all of your files go into src)
- `import React from 'react'` goes at the top of the component
- Write your component code...
- `export default Heading` goes at the bottom of the component
- In App.js import your Heading component: `import Heading from './Heading'`

<!-- > -->

```JS
import React from 'react'

function Heading(props) {
  return <h1>{props.str}</h1>
}

export default Heading
```
