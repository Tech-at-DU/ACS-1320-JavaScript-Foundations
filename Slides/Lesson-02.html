## Class Learning Objectives 📋

- Describe linting
- Use ESLint
- Evaluate your work against professional standards
- Write JS to professional standards
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview 🔎

In this class, you will look at the JS you wrote in the tutorial to improve and upgrade it to modern and professional standards.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Code Quality 🥇

Pair up and discuss code quality. Answer these questions:

- What is code quality?
- What does quality code look like?
- How do you write quality code?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- Consistent style ✅
  - Reads well to Everyone on your team 
  - Uses consistent syntax
- Uses best practices ⭐️
  - e.g. `const` > `let` > `var`
  - Deconstruction `const { a } = Obj`
- DRY
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why is this important? 🤔
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You should be using the professional JS in your work. It is expected in a work environment. 

👨‍💻 👩‍💻 👩‍💼 🧑‍💼
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Improves the quality of your work by reducing errors and making your code easier to understand. 

🙌
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You will be using the Airbnb JS style guide. This guide was developed at Airbnb and is used by their engineering team. It defines the coding style expected from Airbnb engineers.

🔬 🧬 🧫
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Using this style guide is professional best practice, it will make your code better, and make you write higher quality code.**

🏅
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Linting 🔎
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Lint** was the name of a program that flagged suspicious non-portable constructs in C code that were likely to cause bugs. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious code and inconsistent style in any language.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### ESLint 🔎

**ESLint** is a tool that "lints" your JavaScript. It has many options and is widely used. 

You will set up ESLint with a Style guide used by professionals. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**ESlint has two parts:**

1. 🔌 A plugin/extension for your code editor
1. 📦 A package with options specific to your project
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Install eslint in your project**

https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
1️⃣ **Setup npm**

```
npm init -y
```


2️⃣ **Install ESLint** 

```
npm install eslint -g
```

3️⃣ **Setup a config file**

```
npx eslint --init
```

Use the answers below as you follow the setup process. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Choose these options:**

- To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style
- None of these
- None of these
- TypeScript No
- Browser
- Use a popular style guide
- Airbnb: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript 
- JavaScript
- Would you like to install them now with npm? Yes
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Install ESLint in your code editor**

You'll need to install ESLint in your code editor. 

- 1️⃣ Go to Packages/Plugins/Extensions
- 2️⃣ search for ESLint and install. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Lint your code 🧼
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Move your code into a JS file** (If you haven't already)

Then link that to your project. In index.html use: 

`<script src="index.js">__SCRIPT_END__`

<small>The linter will only lint files with the `.js` file extension. Move your code into it a separate JS file `index.js`. </small>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Start Linting** 🦫

Take a look at `index.js`. There should be some red lines highlighting sections of your code. These are linting errors.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
🔬

Move the cursor over these and you'll see notes from the linter telling you how your code doesn't meet the requirements of the style guide. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
🔨

Your job id to figure these out and solve the problems. Your deeper and more important goal job is to do your best to understand why professionals would ask for these changes. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Take a look at the errors you see and answer these questions: 

- 💬 What changes is the linter asking for? 
- 🤔 Why these changes?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## JS Best Practice

You can read about the Airbnb style guide here: 

https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#types

Take a look at the style guide. Pair and discuss.

### JS - Const, Let and Var


Bad 

```JS
var score = 0
```

Goode 

```JS
let score = 0
```

Why? `const` and `let` are block-scoped and are not hoisted. This makes your code more predictable.

`const` defines a value that can not be reassigned. Knowing a value will not be reassigned makes code more efficient. It also adds safety to your program. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### JS - Functions and Hoisting
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
JavaScript is processed in two steps. In the first step, the JavaScript engine examines code and processes it. In the second step, the code is executed. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
One of the processed that happens in the first step is Hoisting. Hoisting effectively moves some elements to the top of their scope. Things that are affected by hoisting are:

- variables declared with var
- functions declarations

https://repl.it/classroom/invite/kHcWR5n
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### JS - Template Strings 

Best Practice use template literal over the + for concatenation. 

Bad!

```JS 
const name = 'joe'
console.log('hello' + name) // concatenate with +
```

Good

```JS
const name = 'joe'
console.log(`hello ${name}`) // concatenate with template literal
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What's wrong with `"" + ?`

The + is used for addition _and concatenation_. 

This makes it ambiguous sometimes and might confuse or generate errors.

```JS
const str = "Score:" + score + 10 // Score:1010
```

✚ is a common source of problems in JS
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wrap up

List linter suggestions on the board. Split into groups of 4 to discuss these. Each group decides why these suggestions were included in the style guide. 

- What changes did the linter ask for? 
- Why do you think these changes? 
- Were linter errors that could not be solved?
