# ACS 1320 - Foundation JavaScript

## Course Description

Build and expand your understanding of JS one of the most important languages in use today. 

During this course you will build three games with the mindset of someone working on, maintaining, and updating a codebase that you are responsible for. Along the way, you will work with many core features of the JavaScript language.

The course will cover foundational JavaScript, debugging JavaScript and working with various JavaScript Libraries to build applications and games. Classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are introduced with a closer look at how OOP is uniquely implemented in JavaScript.  

### Why you should take this course

JavaScript is one of the most important languages in use today. You work with it daily in everything you interact with from web sites to mobile applications, to embedded IoT devices. Applications built with JavaScript have the highest potential impact and the lowest barrier to entry. If you want to create an application and put in front of the widest array of users you'll probably want to build it with JavaScript.

## Prerequisites:  

[ACS 1700](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-Web-Foundations) or equivalent

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course will be able to:

1. Write fundamental JavaScript including variables, loops, conditionals, and classes with professional syntax
1. Design & Implement web games with JS
1. Write functions and differentiate function types; closures, callbacks, and handlers
1. Modify the DOM with JavaScript
1. Define scope and differentiate between function and block scope
1. Use developer tools to debug projects
