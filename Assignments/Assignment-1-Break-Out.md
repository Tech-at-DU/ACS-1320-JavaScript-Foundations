# Class - Breakout 

## Description 

Learn JavaScript by building the classic arcade Break Out. You will use vanilla JS writing all of the code yourself.

### Why this assignment?

This assignment includes a wide range of all features of the JavaScript language. Including functions, variables, arrays, objects, and if-else, and loops. 

**Understanding the concepts used in this project will take you a long way to being able to understand and answer technical questions at interviews.**

Besides basic JS included in the tutorial, you will update everything to modern JavaScript syntax and restructure the code using OOP techniques. 

Last you'll implement a build system and apply modern coding best practice to the project. 

## Project requirements

The start of this project is to complete the tutorial here:

Follow these steps: 

- Create a new GitHub repo
- Follow the tutorial here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
- Create a commit at the end of each step of the tutorial
	- There are 10 steps to the tutorial you should have a commit for each step. 
- After completing the tutorial try the [stretch challenges](#stretch-challenges) below.

### Stretch Challenges 

**Change the colors**

Everything is currently blue and gray. Choose some new colors to customize the game. Change the colors of these elements: 

- Bricks
- Ball
- Paddle
- Background

**Make each row of bricks a different color**

A single color is not very interesting. Make each row a different color. Bricks are managed with a two-dimensional array. 

The code draws all of the bricks with each call to `draw()`, this method calls the `drawBricks()`. You'll need to solve this here. In this method, the variables `c` and `r` hold the number of the column and row for each brick. Change the color by changing the `cxt.fillStyle`. 

See the image below:

**Make each column a different color**

You changed the rows try changing the columns to different colors.

**Alternate colors of bricks**

Alternate the colors of the bricks.

**Make more rows**

The game might be more fun if there were more bricks. Add more bricks in each row. To do this you'll need to change the number of bricks along with the width of each brick. 

Make sure the space between the bricks stays the same.

**Make more rows and columns**

**Offset rows**

**Different sized bricks**

**Make colored bricks worth points**

Make each row of bricks worth a different number of points. The first row is worth 10. The second row is worth 20 and the top row is worth 30 for each brick.

**Custom Background** 

Write a function to draw the background for the game. Currently the `draw()` function clears the canvas on it's first line with: 

`ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);`

Add a function called `drawBackground()`. Call this on the first line of `draw()`.

Try these challenges: 

- Fill the background with a color other than the default color. Do this by drawing a rectangle that starts at x 0, y 0 with a width and height that match your canvas. Do all of this in the `drawBackground()` function. 
- Draw some concetric circles each larger than the last. You could autmate this with a loop. Give each circle a different color. These circles will be the new background to the game. 
- Draw a gradient to fill the background. Read up on using gradients with canvas [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/createLinearGradient).
