# Class - Breakout - Code Quality

## Description 

Improve your code quality by updating your code.

Try to solve the stretch challenges. 

### Why this assignment?

Writing quality code up to professional standards is important. It's hard to know at professional standards are without a guide. The linter will help you write code that meets industry best practices. 

Trying the stretch challenges is an opportunity to stretch your abilities by solving problems.

## Project requirements

Create a new branch for your Break Out Repo. You'll place the work for this assignment there. 

Try all of the challenges below. 

### Challenges 

**Challenge 1** Install the Linter. Follow the instructions from the class. 

Create an npm project in your project directory and install eslint. 

You'll need to install the linter plugin/extension for your code editor also. 

You'll also need to use a style guide. For this assignment, you should be using the Airbnb JavaScript style guide. 

**Challenge 2** Solve the errors the linter identifies in your code. The linter will identify the errors with a red underline and provide some hints as to what the problems are. 

With each change ask yourself why the style guide is asking for that change. Discuss this with other students, TA, or instructor. 

This process should cover the following areas: 

- const, let, and var
- arrow functions 
- template string literals

Pay close attention to these. They are effected by hoisting. A function or var declare lower in code may need to be declared earlier to work properly.

**Stretch Challenge**

Use destructuring where you can. The original code uses lot of objects. Each object is an opportunity to use destructuring. Check out this page for some examples and discussion:

## Add a .gitignore

**Be sure to add a .gitignore at this stage!** You need to ignore node_module. Otherwise you will be uploading these dependencies to your GitHub repositories and I will have trouble grading your homework. 

Follow the instructions here: https://sabe.io/blog/git-ignore-node_modules
